## Squat Depth Classifications

| Depth Category | Knee Flexion Angle | Visual Cue |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Partial/Shallow** | 0° - 90° | Quarter to half squat |
| **Medium** | 90° - 110° | Thigh parallel to floor |
| **Full/Deep** | 110° - 135° | Below parallel |

**Key Finding:** Patellofemoral joint stress increases from 0° to 90° knee flexion. Tibiofemoral compressive forces increase with depth.

## Key Joint Angles

### 1. Knee Angle
**Measurement:** Hip → Knee → Ankle (landmarks 23-25-27 for left, 24-26-28 for right)

- **Standing:** ~180° (fully extended)
- **Shallow squat:** 90° - 120°
- **Medium squat:** 70° - 90°
- **Deep squat:** 45° - 70°

**Clinical Note:** Smaller angles = deeper squat = higher joint stress

### 2. Hip Angle
**Measurement:** Shoulder → Hip → Knee (landmarks 11-23-25 for left, 12-24-26 for right)

- **Standing:** ~180°
- **Medium squat:** 70° - 110°
- **Deep squat:** <70°

**Clinical Note:** Limited hip flexion ROM causes posterior pelvic tilt, leading to lumbar spine flexion (dangerous)

### 3. Trunk Inclination (from vertical)
**Measurement:** Angle of torso relative to vertical axis

- **Upright squat:** 0° - 30° forward lean
- **Moderate lean:** 30° - 45°
- **High forward lean:** >45° (increases hip extensor demand, back stress)

**Critical:** Forward trunk achieved via **hip hinge** (good) vs **spine flexion** (bad)

### 4. Tibia Inclination (from vertical)
**Measurement:** Angle of shin relative to vertical axis

- **Upright tibia:** 0° - 15° forward
- **Moderate forward:** 15° - 30°
- **High forward:** >30° (increases knee extensor demand)

### 5. Trunk-Tibia Angle
**Key Biomechanical Metric:** Trunk inclination minus Tibia inclination

- **Hip extensor bias:** Trunk-Tibia angle **> 10°** (trunk more forward than tibia)
- **Neutral bias:** Trunk-Tibia angle **-10° to 10°**
- **Knee extensor bias:** Trunk-Tibia angle **< -10°** (tibia more forward than trunk)

**Why it matters:** Predicts relative demands on hip vs knee extensors

## Critical Form Parameters

### Spine Position
**Gold Standard:** Maintain **neutral spine** throughout movement

**Danger Zone:**
- Lumbar spine **flexion** (rounding) decreases tolerance to compressive loads
- Causes anterior shear forces on lumbar spine
- Occurs when squatting beyond available hip flexion ROM

**Visual Check:** Look for "butt wink" (posterior pelvic tilt at bottom of squat)

### Stance Width

| Width | Definition | Effects |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Narrow** | 75% - 100% shoulder width | Higher quadriceps demand, lower glute activation |
| **Medium** | 100% - 150% shoulder width | Balanced hip/knee loading |
| **Wide** | 150% - 200% shoulder width | Higher glute activation, higher knee valgus moment (23%), reduces lumbar loading |

### Foot Rotation

- **Neutral:** 0° (feet straight forward)
- **Slight toe-out:** 15° - 20° (common/natural)
- **Moderate toe-out:** 30° (decreases knee valgus moment by 50%, increases varus moment by 80%)

**Finding:** 30° toe-out decreases knee external rotation moment by 20%

**Clinical Note:** Toe-out can be achieved by hip external rotation (good) or knee external rotation (risky)

---

## Common Form Errors

### 1. Knees Caving In (Knee Valgus)
**Biomechanics:** Indicates weak hip abductors/external rotators, increases medial knee stress

**Visual:** Knees track inside of toes during descent

**Fix:** Cue "knees out" or use resistance band around thighs

### 2. Excessive Forward Lean with Spine Flexion
**Biomechanics:** Increases lumbar shear forces, decreases load tolerance

**Visual:** Rounded lower back (loss of lumbar lordosis)

**Fix:** Decrease depth, improve hip mobility, cue "chest up" with neutral spine

### 3. Squatting Beyond Hip ROM (Posterior Pelvic Tilt)
**Biomechanics:** Causes lumbar flexion when hip flexion ROM is exhausted

**Visual:** "Butt wink" - pelvis tucks under at bottom

**Fix:** Limit depth to where neutral spine is maintained

### 4. Heels Lifting Off Ground
**Biomechanics:** Often indicates limited ankle dorsiflexion, shifts weight forward

**Visual:** Heels come up during descent

**Fix:** Improve ankle mobility or use slight heel elevation

### 5. Knees Over Toes (Context-Dependent)
**Biomechanics:** Not inherently dangerous; increases knee flexion moment

**Visual:** Knee tracks past toes when viewed from side

**Note:** Acceptable if controlled and pain-free; some individuals require this due to anatomy

## Biomechanical Principles

### Moment Arms and Joint Loading

**Ground Reaction Force (GRF) vector:**
- Passes **anterior to hip** → creates hip flexion moment → hip extensors must work
- Passes **posterior to knee** → creates knee flexion moment → knee extensors must work

**Trunk forward** → GRF vector shifts anterior → ↑ hip moment, ↓ knee moment

**Tibia forward** → GRF vector shifts away from knee → ↑ knee moment

### Muscle Activation Patterns

**Depth Effects:**
- Gluteus maximus: Increases 65% from shallow to medium depth
- Quadriceps: Conflicting evidence (may increase ~29% with depth)
- Hamstrings: Generally no change or slight decrease

**Stance Width Effects:**
- Wide stance: +13-61% gluteus maximus, -18% gastrocnemius
- No significant effect on quadriceps or hamstrings

**Trunk-Tibia Relationship:**
- Hip bias squat (trunk > tibia): Higher gluteus maximus/hip extensor demand
- Knee bias squat (tibia > trunk): Higher quadriceps demand

### Joint Stress Considerations

**Patellofemoral Joint:**
- Stress increases steadily from 0° to 90° knee flexion
- Deeper squats = higher patellofemoral stress
- Quadriceps force directly increases patellofemoral joint reaction force

**Tibiofemoral Joint:**
- Compressive forces increase with depth
- Contact area decreases with knee flexion → increased contact stress
- Deep squats not recommended for knee OA

**Lumbar Spine:**
- Forward trunk inclination increases back extensor demand
- Lumbar flexion (bad) vs neutral spine with hip hinge (good)
- Beyond 90° knee flexion, lumbar erector spinae activity plateaus (passive structures resist)

## Safe Range Recommendations

### For General Fitness / Healthy Individuals

**Squat Depth:**
- Target: Medium depth (90-110° knee flexion, thigh parallel)
- Limit: Only go as deep as you can maintain neutral spine

**Knee Angle at Bottom:**
- Ideal: **70° - 90°** (medium depth)
- Acceptable: **45° - 110°** (shallow to deep, based on mobility)
- Danger: Avoid if pain occurs at any depth

**Hip Angle at Bottom:**
- Ideal: **70° - 110°**
- Watch for: <70° may trigger posterior pelvic tilt

**Trunk Position:**
- Maintain: **Neutral spine** (slight natural lordosis preserved)
- Forward lean: **<45°** from vertical
- Avoid: Lumbar flexion (rounding)

**Trunk-Tibia Angle:**
- Balanced squat: **-10° to 10°** (neutral bias)
- Hip-focused: **>10°** (hip bias)
- Quad-focused: **<-10°** (knee bias)

**Stance Width:**
- General recommendation: **100-150% shoulder width** (medium)
- Adjust based on goals and mobility

**Foot Position:**
- Neutral to **15-30° toe-out**
- Based on individual hip anatomy and comfort

## Implementation Notes for Code

### Angle Calculations Needed

1. **Knee Angle** (left & right)
   - Points: Hip (23/24) → Knee (25/26) → Ankle (27/28)
   - Expected range during squat: 45° - 180°

2. **Hip Angle** (left & right)
   - Points: Shoulder (11/12) → Hip (23/24) → Knee (25/26)
   - Expected range during squat: 45° - 180°

3. **Back/Spine Angle**
   - Points: Shoulder (11/12) → Hip (23/24) → Ankle (27/28)
   - Helps detect spine flexion vs neutral spine with hip hinge
   - Monitor for changes indicating posterior pelvic tilt

4. **Trunk Inclination** (from vertical)
   - Calculate angle between shoulder-hip line and vertical axis
   - Needed for trunk-tibia angle

5. **Tibia Inclination** (from vertical)
   - Calculate angle between knee-ankle line and vertical axis
   - Needed for trunk-tibia angle

6. **Trunk-Tibia Angle**
   - Trunk inclination minus Tibia inclination
   - Key metric for hip vs knee bias

### Form Rules to Implement

**Depth Safety:**
```
IF knee_angle < 45°:
    WARNING: "Squat depth too deep - risk of joint stress"

IF knee_angle > 110° AND pelvis_tilt_detected:
    WARNING: "Squatting beyond hip mobility - stop before butt wink"
```

**Spine Safety:**
```
IF lumbar_flexion_detected:
    ERROR: "Lower back rounding detected - maintain neutral spine"
    FEEDBACK: "Reduce depth or improve hip mobility"
```

**Knee Safety:**
```
IF knee_valgus_detected:
    WARNING: "Knees caving inward"
    FEEDBACK: "Press knees outward in line with toes"
```

**Optimal Depth (General Fitness):**
```
IF 70° <= knee_angle <= 90°:
    GOOD: "Optimal depth - thigh parallel to floor"

IF 90° < knee_angle < 110°:
    ACCEPTABLE: "Shallow squat - can go deeper if comfortable"

IF knee_angle < 70°:
    INFO: "Deep squat - ensure you can maintain neutral spine"
```

### Scoring Considerations

**Priority Hierarchy (Most to Least Critical):**
1. **Spine position** - Neutral spine is non-negotiable for safety
2. **Depth appropriateness** - Going beyond available ROM is dangerous
3. **Knee alignment** - Valgus increases injury risk
4. **Depth achievement** - Meeting target depth (if mobility allows)
5. **Trunk-tibia relationship** - Optimization for training goals

**Example Penalty System:**
- Lumbar flexion: **-30 points** (major safety issue)
- Posterior pelvic tilt: **-25 points** (depth exceeds mobility)
- Knee valgus: **-20 points** (injury risk)
- Insufficient depth (if able): **-10 points** (not maximizing exercise)
- Non-optimal trunk-tibia angle: **-5 points** (training optimization)

## Key Takeaways for Your Project

1. **Most Critical Metric:** Maintaining **neutral spine** throughout the movement
   - Detect by monitoring back angle consistency
   - Watch for posterior pelvic tilt ("butt wink") at bottom

2. **Depth is Individual:** Don't penalize for not going deep if they're maintaining good form
   - Safe depth = deepest point while maintaining neutral spine
   - Medium depth (70-90° knee angle) is ideal for most people

3. **Trunk-Tibia Angle:** Novel metric from this paper (2024 research)
   - Can help classify squat type (hip vs knee bias)
   - Useful for advanced feedback

4. **Context Matters:** "Knees over toes" isn't inherently bad
   - Depends on individual anatomy (femur/tibia length ratio)
   - Focus on controlled movement and knee alignment

5. **Bilateral Symmetry:** Compare left vs right side
   - Asymmetries in knee or hip angles may indicate imbalances
   - >10° difference between sides warrants attention
